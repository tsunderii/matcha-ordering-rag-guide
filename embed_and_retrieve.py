Unofficial Guide to Ordering Matcha — Milestone 4: Embedding + Vector Store + Retrieval

This script handles the MIDDLE of the RAG pipeline:

    (already done) Ingestion -> Chunking
    (THIS FILE)    Embedding + Vector Store -> Retrieval
    (later)        Generation

It loads the chunks produced in Milestone 3, embeds them with sentence-transformers,
stores them in a ChromaDB collection, and provides a retrieve() function that we test
with the evaluation questions from planning.md.

It does NOT call an LLM or generate answers — that is the next milestone.

Run it with:
    python embed_and_retrieve.py
