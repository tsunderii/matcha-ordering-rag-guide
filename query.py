"""
Unofficial Guide to Ordering Matcha — Milestone 5 (part 1): Grounded Generation

This file connects the retrieval step you already built to a Groq LLM and
produces a GROUNDED answer — meaning the model may only use the chunks we
retrieved, never outside knowledge.

Pipeline position:
    Ingestion -> Chunking -> Embedding + Vector Store -> Retrieval -> (THIS FILE) Generation

It reuses retrieve() from embed_and_retrieve.py exactly as-is. It does NOT
re-embed or re-chunk anything; it just queries the ChromaDB collection that
embed_and_retrieve.py already built and persisted in chroma_db/.

Public function: ask(question) -> dict with keys: answer, sources, retrieved_chunks

      * Retrieval: the previous question is folded into the search query so that
        a follow-up with a pronoun ("Does IT contain milk?") still retrieves the
        right chunks — otherwise "it" has no meaning to the embedding model.
      * Generation: the prior turns are replayed as chat messages before the new
